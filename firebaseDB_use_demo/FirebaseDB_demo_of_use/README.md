# FirebaseDemo Proof of Concept

This proof of concept was created by Surya Selvam when experimenting with how to use Firebase REST APIs and authentication
to retrieve data from a Firebase (firestore service) database. The project helped learn the concept of traditional REST API calls
and how retrieval from a database server may look like in TypeScript/Angular.
The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.4.

## Development of local server - Post 4200

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. Can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
